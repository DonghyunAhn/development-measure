    "The model is composed of (1) machine-driven clustering of satellite images, (2) human guidance on the partial order graph (POG) of image clusters, and (3) a machine-driven rank-wise scoring model to compute siScore. A POG contains information on the relative ranking of each cluster’s development, perceived and judged by each participating human. Knowledge from multiple POGs is summarized as a single representative POG using an ensemble process. This representative POG is then used by the scoring model.\n",

    "Based on the GDP per capita (at current prices USD, 2019), we select five countries that have a similar economic rank to North Korea (198th): Nepal (183rd), Myanmar (174th), Cambodia (169th), Bangladesh (164th), Laos (154th) (16). The grid-level evaluation is based on the density of building area (North Korea) and population estimates (LDCs in Asia) as a proxy for economic development. The district-level performance is calculated using official statistics from census and surveys: density of building area (North Korea), population, establishments and employment (LDCs in Asia). Note that Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is more appropriate to evaluate our model as the model is targeted to predict rank-wise scores.  \n",
